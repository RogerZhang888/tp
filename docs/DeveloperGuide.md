### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

The following provides a quick overview of the main components and their interactions.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* provides its functionality through a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class that implements the corresponding API interface.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in `Logic.java` and implements it in `LogicManager.java`. Other components interact with a component through its interface rather than its concrete class, preventing them from coupling to that component's implementation, as illustrated in the following partial class diagram.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` and its parts, such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentRosterPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All of these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures common behavior among classes that represent visible GUI parts.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in `src/main/resources/view`. For example, [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) specifies the layout of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on `Logic#getStudentRoster()` and immutable `StudentRosterEntry` values because it displays TutorTrack student data.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, it continues to the end of the diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the command is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object, which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above for simplicity, the code can require several interactions between the command object and the `Model` to complete the operation.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddCommandParser`). The parser uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`). The `AddressBookParser` returns that object as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes, such as `AddCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser`, implement the `Parser` interface so they can be treated similarly where appropriate, for example during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the `Person` objects selected by the current filter, such as search results, in a separate _filtered_ list. It exposes this list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that the UI can observe and bind to, so the UI updates when the list changes.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences (currently, just the GUI settings). This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The alternative, arguably more object-oriented, design below keeps a unique list of tags in `AddressBook`, and each `Person` references tags from that list. This lets `AddressBook` maintain one `Tag` object per unique tag instead of each `Person` holding its own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates the actual JSON file access to `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` (one class per data file).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Student identity

TutorTrack's first student-domain slice introduces immutable `Student`, `StudentName`, `ParentGuardianContact`, `Subject`, and `CurrentLevel` value types. The `StudentIdentity` value object is the single source of truth for duplicate detection. It compares a student's name after trimming, collapsing internal whitespace, and converting it to lower case with the parent or guardian phone number after removing spaces and hyphens. Subject, current level, and parent email do not affect identity, so siblings may share a parent phone number.

The command and storage layers will construct `Student` values and delegate duplicate comparisons to `StudentIdentity`; they must not reproduce this normalization logic. This keeps the same duplicate outcome for typed commands and manually edited persisted data.

Student JSON uses `studentId`, `name`, `parentPhone`, optional `parentEmail`, `subject`, and `currentLevel` fields. `StudentId` is an immutable UUID-backed identifier that is generated when a student is created and preserved when the record is saved and reloaded. For older files without `studentId`, `JsonAdaptedStudent` derives a deterministic migration ID from the existing `StudentIdentity`, so legacy data remains loadable and receives a stable ID. `JsonAdaptedStudent` validates every persisted value by rebuilding the corresponding domain types. `JsonSerializableStudentRoster` then checks each loaded Student through `Student#hasSameIdentity`, so JSON data cannot bypass the duplicate rule.

### Student roster contract

`Model#getStudentRoster()` returns an immutable `StudentRoster` snapshot. The roster sorts students by normalized name, assigns one-based indices after sorting, and exposes immutable `StudentRosterEntry` values containing the stable ID, name, subject, current level, and session-note count. Note counts are supplied as projection data so the student-roster context does not own session-note storage; the current student-only model defaults them to zero until the session-note context is integrated. Snapshot construction rejects duplicate student IDs and note-count keys that do not belong to the supplied students.

The `list` command parses only the exact command word and obtains a fresh roster snapshot through `Model#getStudentRoster()`. It reports the number of students for a populated roster and gives an actionable add-student message for an empty roster. JavaFX presentation consumes the same model-facing roster API in the subsequent UI slice.

### Student roster UI

`StudentRosterPanel` copies the immutable roster entries into a JavaFX `ListView`, which provides scrolling for larger rosters. Each cell creates a `StudentRosterCard` from one `StudentRosterEntry`; the card displays the one-based index, name, subject, current level, and session-note count. When the snapshot is empty, the panel hides the list cells and shows an actionable message explaining how to add a student. `MainWindow` refreshes the panel from `Logic#getStudentRoster()` after each successful command.

### Roster listing integration

`RosterListingIntegrationTest` adds students through `LogicManager`, verifies the saved JSON can be reloaded, and checks normalized ordering, one-based indices, and stable IDs across the reload. It also verifies the empty persisted-roster path and the roster projection's note-count input. Non-zero counts from actual session notes remain dependent on the separate Session Note implementation; the current student-only application reports zero for newly added students.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, it continues to the end of the diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo execute:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.

  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

### Adding a student

1. Enter `add n/Alicia Lim p/+65 9123 4567 e/mrs.lim@example.com sub/Mathematics l/Secondary 3`.
   Expected: TutorTrack confirms that Alicia Lim was added.
2. Repeat the command with `n/alicia lim` and `p/+65-9123-4567`.
   Expected: TutorTrack rejects it as a duplicate student and preserves the existing record.
3. Enter `add n/Bea Lim p/+65 9123 4567 sub/English l/Secondary 2`.
   Expected: TutorTrack accepts the sibling because the student name differs.

### Listing the student roster

1. Empty roster

   1. Start TutorTrack with no student records and enter `list`.
      Expected: The roster panel shows a clear message explaining that there are no students and how to use `add`.
2. Populated roster

   1. Add students with different names, subjects, and levels, then enter `list`.
      Expected: Cards appear in normalized alphabetical order and each card shows its index, name, subject, level, and session-note count.
   2. Resize the window or add enough students to exceed the panel height.
      Expected: The roster remains usable through the list's vertical scrolling.
   3. Add another student and enter `list` again.
      Expected: The displayed roster refreshes and indices match the new alphabetical order.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command, with multiple persons in the list.
